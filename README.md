# Livebox 3/4 control command line tool 1.2.1
## Presentation
Allow to easily control Livebox 3/4 (internet box from Orange ISP) by CLI, easing home automation tasks.

## Installation
```
# Get the application
wget https://devgiants.github.io/livebox/downloads/livebox-1.2.1.phar

# Move it in command folder
mv livebox-1.2.1.phar /usr/bin/livebox

# Make it executable
chmod u+x /usr/bin/livebox
```
## Authentication
Some commands require authentication, some not. An authentication file in yaml must be provided :
```yml
configuration:
  # Optional: specify Livebox local DNS name or IP. Default to 192.168.1.1
  host: 192.168.1.1
  # Optional: specify user to use for connection
  user: admin

  password: pass
```

This authentication file can be passed by 2 different ways :
1) Just make a `xxx.yml` that would lie with the `livebox` tool. It will be automatically handled. _Note: For this option, commands will be shorter (such as `livebox wifi:switch on` instead of `livebox wifi:switch on --file=/path/to/yaml.yml`) but in this very case you shouldn't put those 2 files in `/usr/bin/`, because this is not the configuration file place._
2) Make your YAML config file and explicitly pass it to commands.

## Commands
As every [Console component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html)-based application, you can have detailled command list by doing `livebox list`
_Note: as stated above, all commands below take one `--file` option to pass a configuration file path_
###Â Wan info
`livebox wan:infos`

Will return a json object with all following data

```json

## Technical explanation
I created this script mainly using reverse engineering, and also checking excellent work on [sysbus script by rene-d](https://github.com/rene-d/sysbus).
